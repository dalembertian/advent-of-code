# Advent of Code

I have never participated in the AoC before, started this year (2024). It was WAY more work than I expected, but it was fun and enriching. I accidentally did Day 19 from 2015 - it was linked and I thought it was part of it[^1]! 😀🤦🏻‍♂️

[^1]: Maybe because of the, the "curse of Day 19" kicked in and it was the last one I did... 🙄
