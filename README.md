# Advent of Code

I have never participated in the AoC before, started this year (2024). It was WAY more work than I expected, but it was fun and enriching. I accidentally did Day 19 from 2015 - it was linked and I thought it was part of it[^1]! üòÄü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**SPOILER ALERT**: some personal insights below, under the image.

Some insights after completing this challenge:

* It took a LOT of time - granted, I'm rusty, but I see many others on the same boat. I couldn't do it with just a couple of hours per day: some took me days to get right. The very last one I only finished on the first day of they year, and only because I got sick and had a lot of time in bed!

* After day 10, we need to pay **really** good attention to the problem description, as there's tricky details and/or  misleading clues (intentional or not). Several times I realized I was interpreting things slighlty wrong, after spending hours and hours trying.

* Around day 15 or so, just brute-force the way out doesn't work anymore. Many times I had to spend some good time analyzing the problem, identifying the key aspect and doing some research to refresh my memory on algorithms: graphs, dynamic programing, etc.

* Speaking about dynamic programing: memoization was key for at least 4 of the problems. As to other classic techniques, I used Dijkstra twice (had to actually remove a 3rd use in exchange for memoization!), Kahn, Bron-Kerbosch, ...

* All in all, it was great. I loved to check others' solutions after I did mine, and I learned a lot in doing so, from simple Python tricks to really cool and elegant solutions. I don't think I'll be able to do another one end-to-end without risking a divorce, but let's see by December 2025!

[^1]: Maybe because of this, the "curse of Day 19" kicked in, and the 19th of 2024 was the last day I managed to complete... üôÑ
